* Setting up a Dev Environment

When working on a python project, a common way that people will manage their dependencies is running =pip freeze > requirements.txt= and coupling that with =virtualenv= to manage project level dependencies.

Often, when reproducing somebody else's analysis, it is not enough to run =pip install -r requirements.txt= in the repository.  

However, sometimes there are configurations that are specific system level dependencies that are not captured. As I go along with developing my code, I will install system-level dependencies as required by the package.  

To be able to replicate all the system level dependencies, you can see how Docker could easily be used! 

Now we move to the next stage, which is figuring out how to layer instructions, and put together a Dockerfile to set up a docker container with your exact specifications to replicate your results. 

In the past few weeks, we have observed the following issues: 
1. Somebody builds a tool in a different flavour of python with several package changes 
2. Having pandas 0.20 on one machine and pandas 0.21 on another can change how the metrics are calculated slightly
3. Struggling to manage =virtualenvs= for different packages, broken =virtualenvs=

Here, I will spin up a Python container, with all the tools/packages that are required for my project.
This includes setting up a Jupyter notebook server with access to all those packages.

I can open a Jupyter notebook in this container, and I am able to import all the packages that I need inside this Jupyter notebook.


The use case we will explore here, is setting up a python machine with all the tools required for a project, and then setting up a jupyter notebook server within to access all those resources: 

In the terminal run:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
docker build -t devenv .
#+END_EXAMPLE

This should set up a jupyter notebook that you will be able to access with all the tools in the =requirements.txt= file installed. 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
docker run -p 8888:8888 devenv
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now access it from your machine, try =localhost:8888=. It will ask you to copy and paste the token you were given.
